Welcome to PWRbuster!

This is more or less just a small read me but it's a good intro.

So, what exactly is PWRbuster?
Well, PWRbuster is a cybersecurity open source program that has the goal of making passwords more secure by randomly generating them; though for the time being it is very very very basic.

How will it be released?
Well, as of now i'm planning on releasing new versions every month or so, though as I learn that time could change.

What Programming language does it use?
It's first code will be java, this is due to it working on Windows, MacOS, and Linux

As of now, this is all, though I will always take advice from people who send me emails.

Hope to see all of you soon!
Best regards, PWRbuster!
